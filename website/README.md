# Anki Cards Generator Website

This is web interface for Anki Cards Generator written in pure HTML + Vanilla JS.

## Run

First, make sure backend server is up and running.

Then run:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000 -d src
# or simply
./run.sh
```

## Notes

For now, only works on localhost, because endpoint path is hardcoded in JS.
